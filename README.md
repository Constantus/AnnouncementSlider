# AnnouncementSlider
A simple HTML/CSS/Javascript slideshow that allows for the use of images, text or a combination of the two. The slide indicators at the bottom are automatically generated by js base on the number of slides present. The only two major requirements are that the individual slides must have the class: "slideItem". And that the first and last slides must be copied so that there is a copy of the last slide before the first slide and a copy of the first slide after the last slide. And each must have the id of "lastClone" and "firstClone" respectively.
